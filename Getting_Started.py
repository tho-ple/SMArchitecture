Welcome to **SMArchitecture** ‚Äî a tool for **semantic analysis and clustering of software requirements** to support early **architecture discovery**.

---

### üß≠ What this app does

This app helps you:
1. **Manage and import requirements** (manually, from CSV, or Gherkin feature files).  
2. **Generate embeddings** using local language models (no OpenAI key required).  
3. **Cluster semantically similar requirements** to discover potential architectural components.  
4. **Visualize embeddings** and observe emerging groups that hint at design boundaries.

You can switch between **pages** in the sidebar:
- üß© **Manage Requirements:** Add, import, or export requirements.  
- üîç **Analyze Requirements:** Generate embeddings, cluster, and visualize results.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to use

1. Go to **Manage Requirements** and enter or import your functional requirements.  
2. Navigate to **Analyze Requirements**.  
3. Click **Generate Embeddings** ‚Äî the app will compute vector representations for each requirement.  
4. Choose a clustering method (DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, or Agglomerative) and adjust sensitivity.  
5. Explore the 2D visualization to identify related requirement groups.  
6. Use the emerging clusters to propose **system components** or **design boundaries**.

### üçï Example: Pizza Delivery
Here‚Äôs an example set of mixed functional and non-functional requirements for a fictional pizza delivery system.  
You can load these into the app and run the analysis immediately.
