Welcome to the **Requirement Analyzer** ‚Äî a tool to help you **analyze and structure software requirements** 
based on their semantic similarity.

Instead of manually grouping requirements, this app uses **language embeddings** and **automatic clustering** to reveal
emerging **themes or design areas**.  
These clusters can guide early **architectural decisions**, such as identifying modules, subsystems, or bounded contexts.

# ---------- HOW IT WORKS ----------
st.header("‚öôÔ∏è How It Works")

st.markdown("""
1. **Input Requirements**  
   Add or import your requirements via the **üßæ Manage Requirements** page.  
   You can also load an example dataset below.

2. **Embedding Generation & Vector Storage**  
   The app converts each requirement into a high-dimensional vector using a **Sentence Transformer model**.  
   These embeddings are stored locally in **ChromaDB**, a lightweight, persistent vector database.

3. **Semantic Clustering**  
   ChromaDB groups semantically similar requirements using **vector similarity search**.  
   Each group represents a **potential component** or **bounded context**.

4. **Naming the Components**  
   The app analyzes key terms in each cluster to **suggest a name** ‚Äî  
   which you can refine to describe the architecture's emerging structure.

### Step-by-step

1. **Go to ‚Äúüßæ Manage Requirements‚Äù** in the sidebar.  
   - Add requirements manually  
   - Or import them from a CSV or Gherkin `.feature` file  
2. **Then open ‚Äúüìä Analyze Requirements.‚Äù**  
   - Select an embedding model  
   - Adjust the *minimum cluster size* (optional)  
   - Click **Run Analysis**  
3. Review the discovered clusters, rename them meaningfully, and export results to CSV.

### Why use clustering for design?
- Groups of related requirements often correspond to **potential architectural modules**
- Helps identify **redundant** or **conflicting** requirements
- Reveals **natural domains** in complex systems
